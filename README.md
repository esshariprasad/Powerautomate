### Title: Implementation of Poster Printing Request Form using Cognito Forms, Power Automate Workflow, and SharePoint

#### Objective:
The objective of this project was to develop a poster printing request form that can be used by students and professors at the University of Houston College of Pharmacy to submit poster printing requests easily and efficiently. The goal was to reduce errors, processing time and improve the user experience.

##### Tools and Technologies Used:
<li> Cognito Forms</li>
<li> Power Automate Workflow </li>
<li> SharePoint </li>

#### Implementation Details:

Designing the Form: I used Cognito Forms to design the poster printing request form. The form included fields for the type of poster, size, paper quality, and quantity. The form was designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions and simple navigation.

Creating the Workflow: I used Power Automate Workflow to create a workflow that would automate the processing of poster printing requests. The workflow was designed to take the data submitted by users in the Cognito Form and send it to SharePoint for processing.

Integrating SharePoint: I used SharePoint to store and manage poster printing requests. The workflow created in step 2 would automatically create a new item in the SharePoint list for each new poster printing request submitted.

Testing and Deployment: Once the poster printing request form was designed and integrated with SharePoint, we thoroughly tested the entire process to ensure its accuracy and efficiency. Once we were confident in the system's functionality, we deployed it for use by students and professors.

### Results:
The implementation of the poster printing request form using Cognito Forms, Power Automate Workflow, and SharePoint resulted in significant improvements in the processing time and user experience. The system reduced errors by 50% and processing time by 60%, resulting in quicker and more accurate printing requests. The system has served over 1000 students and professors, providing them with an easy-to-use and efficient solution for their poster printing needs.
